             The Some Congestion Experienced ECN Codepoint
                     draft-morton-taht-tsvwg-sce-00

Abstract

   This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of
   congestion on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM
   algorithms and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE.
   It is a simple, transparent, and backward compatible upgrade to
   existing IETF-approved AQMs, RFC3168, and nearly all congestion
   control algorithms.

1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of
   congestion on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM
   algorithms and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE
   ("Congestion Experienced").

   This memo limits its scope to the redefinition of the ECT(1)
   codepoint as SCE, "Some Congestion Experienced", with a few brief
   illustrations of how it may be used.

3.  Background

   [RFC3168] defines the lower two bits of the (former) TOS byte in the
   IPv4/6 header as the ECN field.  This may take four values: Not-ECT,
   ECT(0), ECT(1) or CE.

    00     Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)     [RFC 3168]
    01     ECT(1) (ECN-Capable Transport(1))       [RFC 3168]
    10     ECT(0) (ECN-Capable Transport(0))       [RFC 3168]
    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [RFC 3168]

   Research has shown that the ECT(1) codepoint goes essentially unused,
   with the "Nonce Sum" extension to ECN having not been implemented in
   practice and thus subsequently obsoleted by [RFC8311] (section 3).
   Additionally, known [RFC3168] compliant senders do not emit ECT(1),
   and compliant middleboxes do not alter the field to ECT(1), while
   compliant receivers all interpret ECT(1) identically to ECT(0).
   These are useful properties which represent an opportunity for
   improvement.

   Experience gained with 7 years of [RFC8290] deployment in the field
   suggests that it remains difficult to maintain the desired 100% link
   utilisation, whilst simultaneously strictly minimising induced delay
   due to excess queue depth - irrespective of whether ECN is in use.
   This leads to a reluctance amongst hardware vendors to implement the
   most effective AQM schemes because their headline benchmarks are
   throughput-based.

   The underlying cause is the very sharp "multiplicative decrease"
   reaction required of transport protocols to congestion signalling
   (whether that be packet loss or CE marks), which tends to leave the
   congestion window significantly smaller than the ideal BDP when
   triggered at only slightly above the ideal value.  The availability
   of this sharp response is required to assure network stability (AIMD
   principle), but there is presently no standardised and backwards-
   compatible means of providing a less drastic signal.

4.  Some Congestion Experienced

   As consensus has arisen that some form of ECN signaling should be an
   earlier signal than drop, this Internet Draft changes the meaning of
   ECT(1) to be SCE, meaning "Some Congestion Experienced".  The above
   ECN-field codepoint table then becomes:

    00     Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)     [@RFC3168]
    01     SCE (Some Congestion Experienced)       [This Internet-draft]
    10     ECT (ECN-Capable Transport)             [@RFC3168]
    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [@RFC3168]

   This permits middleboxes implementing AQM to signal incipient
   congestion, below the threshold required to justify setting CE, by
   converting some proportion of ECT codepoints to SCE ("SCE marking").
   Existing [RFC3168] compliant receivers MUST transparently ignore this
   new signal with respect to congestion control, and both existing and
   SCE-aware middleboxes MAY convert SCE to CE in the same circumstances
   as for ECT, thus ensuring backwards compatibility with [RFC3168] ECN
   endpoints.

   Permitted ECN codepoint packet transitions by middleboxes are:

           Not-ECT ->   Not-ECT or DROP
           ECT     ->   ECT or SCE or CE or DROP
           SCE     ->   SCE or CE or DROP
           CE      ->   CE or DROP

   In other words, for ECN-aware flows, the ECN marking of an individual
   packet MAY be increased by a middlebox to signal congestion, but MUST
   NOT be decreased, and packets SHALL NOT be altered to appear to be
   ECN-aware if they were not originally, nor vice versa.  Note however
   that SCE is numerically less than ECT, but semantically greater, and
   the latter definition applies for this rule.

   New SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols SHALL continue to
   apply the [RFC3168] interpretation of the CE codepoint, that is, to
   signal the sender to back off send rate to the same extent as if a
   packet loss were detected.  This maintains compatibility with
   existing middleboxes, senders and receivers.

   New SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols SHOULD interpret the
   SCE codepoint as an indication of mild congestion, and respond
   accordingly by applying send rates intermediate between those
   resulting from a continuous sequence of ECT codepoints, and those
   resulting from a CE codepoint.  The ratio of ECT and SCE codepoints
   received indicates the relative severity of such congestion, such
   that 100% SCE is very close to the threshold of CE marking, 100% ECT
   indicates that the bottleneck link may not be fully utilised, and
   some mixture of ECT and SCE codepoints indicates that the present
   send rate is a good match to the bottleneck link.

   Details of how to implement SCE awareness at the transport layer will
   be left to additional Internet Drafts yet to be submitted.  To ensure
   RTT-fair convergence with single-queue SCE AQMs, transports SHOULD

   stabilise at higher SCE ratios for higher BDPs, and MAY reduce their
   response to CE marks IFF they are responding to SCE signals received
   at around the same time (eg. in adjacent packets, or at least during
   the same RTT) in the same flow.

   To maximise the benefit of SCE, middleboxes SHOULD produce SCE
   markings sooner than they produce CE markings, when the level of
   congestion increases.

5.  Examples of use

5.1.  Codel-type AQMs

   A simple and natural way to implement SCE in a Codel-type AQM is to
   mark all ECT packets as SCE if they are over half the Codel target
   sojourn time, and not marked CE by Codel itself.  This threshold
   function does not necessarily produce the best performance, but is
   very easy to implement and provides useful information to SCE-aware
   flows, often sufficient to avoid receiving CE marks whilst still
   efficiently using available capacity.

   For a more sophisticated approach avoiding even small-scale
   oscillation, a stochastic ramp function may be implemented with 100%
   marking at the Codel target, falling to 0% marking at or above zero
   sojourn time.  The lower point of the ramp should be chosen so that
   SCE is not accidentally signalled due to CPU scheduling latencies or
   serialisation delays of single packets.  Absent rigorous analysis of
   these factors, setting the lower limit at half the Codel target
   should be safe in many cases.

   The default configuration of Codel is 100ms interval, 5ms target.  A
   typical ramp function for these parameters might cease marking below
   2.5ms sojourn time, increase marking probability linearly to 100% at
   5ms, and mark at 100% for sojourn times above 5ms (in which CE
   marking is also possible).

   Flow-isolating AQMs should avoid signalling SCE to flows classified
   as "sparse" in order to encourage the fastest possible convergence to
   the fair share.

   For the avoidance of doubt, a decision to mark CE or to drop a packet
   always takes precedence over SCE marking.

5.2.  RED-type AQMs (including PIE)

   There are several reasonable methods of producing SCE signals in a
   RED-type AQM.




Morton, et al.          Expires October 10, 2019                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    sceb                        April 2019


   The simplest would be a threshold function, giving a hard boundary in
   queue depth between 0% and 100% SCE marking.  This could be a
   sensible option for limited hardware implementations.  The threshold
   should be set below the point at which a growing queue might trigger
   CE marking or packet drops.

   Another option would be to implement a second marking probability
   function, occupying a queue-depth space just below that occupied by
   the main marking probability function.  This should be arranged so
   that high marking rates (ideally 100%) are achieved at or before the
   point at which CE marking or packet drops begin.

   For PIE specifically, a second marking probability function could be
   added with the same parameters as the main marking probability
   function, except for a lower QDELAY_REF value.  This would result in
   the SCE marking probability remaining strictly higher than the CE
   marking probability for ECT flows.

5.3.  TCP

   Some mechanism should be defined to feed back SCE signals to the
   sender explicitly.  Details of this are left to future I-Ds covering
   TCP in detail; use could be made of the redundant NS bit in the TCP
   header, which was formerly associated with ECT(1) in the Nonce Sum
   specification.

   Alternatively, SCE can potentially be handled entirely by the
   receiver, and thus be entirely independent of any of the dozens of
   [RFC3168] compliant congestion control algorithms on the sender side.
   This would be done by adjusting the Receive Window, which has been a
   standard part of TCP from its inception.  This alternative therefore
   requires the minimum amount of protocol changes on the wire.

5.4.  Other

   New transports under development, such as QUIC, may implement a fine-
   grained signal back to the sender based on SCE.  QUIC itself appears
   to have this sort of feedback already (counting ECT(0), ECT(1) and CE
   packets received), and the data should be made available for
   congestion control.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

8.  Security Considerations

   An adversary could inappropriately set SCE marks at middleboxes he
   controls to slow down SCE-aware flows, eventually reaching a minimum
   congestion window.  However, the same threat already exists with
   respect to inappropriately setting CE marks on normal ECN flows, and
   this would have a greater impact per mark.  Therefore no new threat
   is exposed by SCE in practice.

   An adversary could also simply ignore SCE marks at the receiver, or
   ignore SCE information fed back from the receiver to the sender, in
   an attempt to gain some advantage in throughput.  Again, the same
   could be said about ignoring CE marks, so no truly new threat is
   exposed.  Additionally, correctly implemented SCE detection may
   actually improve long-term goodput compared to ignoring SCE.

   An adversary could erase congestion information by converting SCE
   marks to ECT or Not-ECT codepoints, thus hiding it from the receiver.
   This has equivalent effects to ignoring SCE signals at the receiver.
   An identical threat already exists for erasing congestion information
   from CE marked packets, and may be mitigated by AQMs switching to
   dropping packets from flows observed to be non-responsive to CE.
